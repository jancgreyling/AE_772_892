    "Pandas, derived from the term \"panel data,\" is a robust, open-source data analysis library for Python. It provides fast, flexible, and expressive data structures designed to work with both structured (tabular, multidimensional, and potentially heterogeneous) and time series data.\n",

    "- **Series**:\n",
    "  - A one-dimensional labeled array capable of holding any data type.\n",
    "  - It has an index and values.\n",
    "  - Example:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    import pandas as pd\n",
    "    import numpy as np\n",
    "\n",
    "    s = pd.Series([1, 3, 5, np.nan, 6, 8])\n",
    "    print(s)\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **DataFrame**:\n",
    "  - A two-dimensional labeled data structure with rows and columns.\n",
    "  - Can be visualized like a spreadsheet or SQL table.\n",
    "  - Columns can be of different types (numeric, string, boolean, etc.).\n",
    "  - Example:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    data = {'name': ['John', 'Anna', 'Lucas'],\n",
    "            'age': [28, 22, 19],\n",
    "            'city': ['New York', 'London', 'Berlin']}\n",

    "## Data Manipulation: Filtering, Sorting, and Grouping\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Filtering**:\n",
    "  - Use conditions to select specific rows.\n",
    "  - Example to filter records where age is greater than 20:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    filtered_data = df[df['age'] > 20]\n",
    "    print(filtered_data)\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "  Let's break down what is happing step by step:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. **`df['age']`**: This part of the code selects the 'age' column from the DataFrame `df`. The result is a pandas Series containing all the values in the 'Age' column.\n",
    "\n",
    "    2. **`df['age'] > 20`**: This is a conditional operation that's applied to the 'age' Series. It will return another Series of the same length, but instead of ages, it will contain boolean values (`True` or `False`). A value will be `True` if the corresponding age is greater than 20, and `False` otherwise. For example, if `df['age']` contains `[18, 21, 19, 22, 25]`, then `df['age'] > 20` will return `[False, True, False, True, True]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "    3. **`df[...]`**: The outer `df[...]` is used to index (or select) rows from the DataFrame `df`. When you use a boolean Series to index a DataFrame like this, pandas will select all rows that correspond to `True` values in the boolean Series. Using our earlier example, only the rows with ages 21, 22, and 25 will be selected.\n",
    "\n",
    "    4. **`filtered_data = ...`**: The result of the above operations, which is a subset of the original DataFrame with only the rows where age is greater than 20, is then assigned to the variable `filtered_data`.\n",
    "\n",
    "  In essence, the logic of `filtered_data = df[df['age'] > 20]` is: \"From the DataFrame `df`, give me a new DataFrame (`filtered_data`) that only contains rows where the value in the 'Age' column is greater than 20.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sorting**:\n",
    "  - Arrange data based on the values of specific columns.\n",
    "  - Example for sorting by age:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    sorted_data = df.sort_values(by='age', ascending=False)\n",
    "    print(sorted_data)\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Grouping**:\n",
    "  - Aggregate data based on column values.\n",
    "  - Example to group by city and get the average age:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    grouped_data = df.groupby('city')['age'].mean()\n",
    "    print(grouped_data)\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "  - Note the structure \n",
    "    1. **`df.groupby('city')`**: This groups the DataFrame `df` by the unique values in the 'city' column. The result is a `GroupBy` object which is a special type of pandas object that has similar properties to a DataFrame but represents a collection of groups (or segments) of your data.\n",
    "    2. **`df.groupby('city')['age']`**: This selects the 'age' column from each group. Now, you have a `GroupBy` object that is focused on the 'age' values for each city.\n",
    "    3. **`.mean()`**: This calculates the mean (or average) of the 'age' values for each city.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lets look at more examples"

    "   Select rows where 'Name' is either 'Alice' or 'Bob':\n",

    "   ```python\n",
    "   specific_names = df[df['Name'].isin(['Alice', 'Bob'])]\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   Certainly! First, let's ensure that the column names are more consistent (typically they're kept in lowercase). I'll then provide an example using the `isin` method for the \"is not in\" condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Using `isin` for \"is not in\" condition**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   To filter rows where the 'name' is neither 'Alice' nor 'Bob':\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   not_specific_names = df[~df['name'].isin(['Alice', 'Bob'])]\n",
    "   ```\n",

    "## Using `loc` in Pandas\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basics:\n",
    "\n",
    "The `loc` attribute is primarily label-based indexing. It's used to access a group of rows and columns by labels or a boolean array.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Syntax:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "dataframe.loc[row_indexer, column_indexer]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Selecting a Single Row by Index**:\n",
    "    Assuming indices are default integers:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    row_1 = df.loc[1]\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Selecting Rows by Range of Index**:\n",
    "    Get rows 1 through 3:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    rows_1_to_3 = df.loc[1:3]\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Selecting Specific Columns for Specific Rows**:\n",
    "For rows 1 through 3, get columns 'name' and 'age':\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    subset = df.loc[1:3, ['name', 'age']]\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Selecting All Rows for Specific Columns**:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    names_and_cities = df.loc[:, ['name', 'city']]\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Using Boolean Conditions**:\n",
    "Select all rows where age is above 30:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    above_30 = df.loc[df['age'] > 30]\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Using Multiple Conditions**:\n",
    "Select all rows where age is above 30 and city is 'London':\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    london_above_30 = df.loc[(df['age'] > 30) & (df['city'] == 'London')]\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Setting Values for Specific Rows/Columns**:\n",
    "Set age to 40 for the person named 'Alice':\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    df.loc[df['name'] == 'Alice', 'age'] = 40\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Important Points:\n",
    "\n",
    "- When using `loc` with a single bracket (like `df.loc[2]`), it'll return a Series representing that row. If you want it as a DataFrame, use a double bracket (like `df.loc[[2]]`).\n",
    "\n",
    "- The end value in a range specified in `loc` (like `df.loc[1:3]`) is **inclusive**, which is different from Python's standard slicing where the end value is exclusive.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Always ensure the values you're using within `loc` match the data type of the index. If the index is of string type, use string values, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Be careful when modifying slices. You're directly modifying the original DataFrame unless you explicitly work on a copy."
